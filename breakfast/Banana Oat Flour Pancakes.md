# Banana Oat Flour Pancakes

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup oat flour
- 2 bananas
- 3 eggs
- 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)

## Method

1. Mash everything together in a mixing bowl.
1. Pour onto hot griddle or pan over medium low heat.
1. Flip them when the edges start to dry or bubbles in the center don't pop and reform anymore. Note: the sugar in the bananas can burn easily; low heat is probably best.
1. Top with sunflower butter and jam or whatever you like!
