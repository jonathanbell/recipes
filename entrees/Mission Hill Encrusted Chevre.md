# Mission Hill Encrusted Chevre (Goat's Cheese)

## Ingredients

* 2 ~6cm discs of chevre about 3cm high
* 1/2 cup diced and toasted almonds
* 1/2 cup sesame seeds
* 1/4 cup chia seeds
* 2 cups pistachios
* 1 teaspoon lemon juice
* 1/2 cup dried cranberries
* 1/2 cup toasted and salted cashews
* 1 orange
* 1/2 grapefruit
* 1 bunch of parsley
* 1 package pea shoots
* ~3/4-1 cup olive oil
* salt and pepper to taste
* 1 cup quinoa
* 2 cups vegetable stock

## Method

1. Start by cooking the quinoa in the vegetable stock with the cranberries and almonds.
1. Cut the pistachios and cashews into very small pieces with a sharp knife.
1. Toast the pistachios and cashews in a frying pan on low heat. When they are almost done, add the chia seeds and the sesame seeds.
1. Make a parsley pesto by blending the whole bunch of parsley, adding the olive oil as you blend. Add just enough olive oil to make a thick paste, about the consitency of very thick maple syrup. Then toss in the lemon juice to taste.
1. Cut up the orange and grapefruit into bite sized peices.
1. When the quiona is done, toss in most of the grapefruit and orange peices.
1. Add some salt and pepper to the quinoa to taste.
1. Take the mixture of toasted nuts and seeds and lay it out onto something flat.
1. Take the disc of goat cheese and roll and press the nut/seed mixture into the cheese. Encrust the whole thing. Hopefully, the nuts are still warm and they will warm the cheese up. If not, re-warm the cheese on very low heat back in the frying pan.
1. Make a bed of parsley pesto on a plate - don't be shy!
1. Next to and slightly over the pesto place a serving of the quinoa.
1. Then place the disc of cheese on top of the quinoa.
1. Add the remaining orange and grapefruit peices, placing them around the plate.
1. Finally, garnish with a generous ammount of pea shoots onto of everything and serve.
